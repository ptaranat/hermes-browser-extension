# Hermes Browser Extension

Browser-native side panel for [Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs) — connect web context to your local Hermes runtime.

> Created by **Jon Komet** (`@abundantbeing`). Community extension for Hermes Agent by Nous Research.

## What it is

Hermes Browser Extension is not a browser chatbot. It is a Chrome/Edge side panel for the real Hermes Agent runtime. It talks to your local Hermes Gateway/API server, so it can use the models, tools, skills, sessions, memory, and MCP servers already configured in Hermes.

This repo is specifically for the **extension**. A future standalone **Hermes Browser** may become a separate native macOS/Linux/Windows app built on the groundwork from this extension.

## Status

Public alpha. Load unpacked. Local-first. Read-only browser context. **Not on the Chrome Web Store yet.**

## Features

- Chrome/Edge/Chromium MV3 side panel powered by the Side Panel API.
- Connects to a local Hermes API server at `http://127.0.0.1:8642`, or a remote https dashboard over its WebSocket (see [Remote gateway](#remote-gateway-advanced)).
- Auto-syncs the connected Hermes runtime's providers/models, profiles, skills, and sessions after Connect/Test/Save and on side-panel startup.
- Sends active page/browser context to a persisted Hermes session.
- Captures active tab title/URL, open tabs, selected text, readable page text, metadata, headings, forms, links, and buttons where available.
- Supports voice dictation through the local Hermes audio transcription API, with a visible extension voice tab fallback for Chromium side-panel microphone blocks.
- Wraps webpage text as untrusted browser context before sending it to Hermes.
- Streams Hermes responses and falls back to non-streaming chat when needed.
- Uses local extension storage for the Gateway URL and API key/browser token.
- No `debugger`, `nativeMessaging`, click/type/form-submit, cookies, history, bookmarks, downloads, or browser-control permissions in v0.1.

## Requirements

- Hermes Agent installed and working.
- Hermes Gateway/API server enabled locally.
- Node.js 20+.
- Chrome, Edge, Brave, Comet, or another Chromium browser with Side Panel API support (Chrome 114+ baseline).

## Quick start walkthrough

### 1. Clone and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abundantbeing/hermes-browser-extension.git
cd hermes-browser-extension
npm install
npm run build
```

The loadable extension is generated at:

```text
dist/
```

### 2. Load unpacked in Chrome/Edge

1. Open `chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions`.
2. Enable **Developer mode**.
3. Click **Load unpacked**.
4. Select the repo's `dist/` folder — not the repo root and not `extension/`.
5. Pin/click the Hermes extension icon to open the side panel.

After code updates, run `npm run build` again and click **Reload** on the Hermes Browser Extension card in the browser extensions page.

### 3. Enable the Hermes API server

Use Hermes config when available:

```bash
hermes config set API_SERVER_ENABLED true
hermes config set API_SERVER_HOST 127.0.0.1
hermes config set API_SERVER_PORT 8642
hermes config set API_SERVER_KEY your-strong-local-secret
hermes gateway
```

If using `.env` directly, keep values local and use placeholders in docs/issues:

```bash
API_SERVER_ENABLED=true
API_SERVER_HOST=127.0.0.1
API_SERVER_PORT=8642
API_SERVER_KEY=<your-local-secret>
API_SERVER_CORS_ORIGINS=*
```

Keep the API server bound to localhost unless you have a hardened deployment plan. The Hermes API server can access the real Hermes runtime and tools.

### 4. Verify the local API server

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8642/health
# HERMES_AUTH should be your full local Authorization header value.
curl -H "Authorization: ${HERMES_AUTH}" http://127.0.0.1:8642/v1/models
```

### 5. Connect the extension

In the side panel first-run screen:

1. Click **Connect to Hermes** and approve locally if your Hermes Desktop/gateway supports the approval flow.
2. If approval is not available yet, click **Manual setup**.
3. Enter:
   - Gateway URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8642`
   - API key / browser token: your local `API_SERVER_KEY`
   - Session ID: `hermes-browser-extension`
   - Session title: `Hermes Browser Extension`
4. Click **Test connection**. This probes `/health`, `/v1/models`, and session creation, then refreshes skills and profiles.
5. Click **Save settings**.
6. Open a normal `https://` page, then ask something like: `Summarize this page in one sentence.`

After connection, the side panel automatically loads from the connected Hermes gateway:

- `/v1/models` — all providers/models Hermes can enumerate, including provider-qualified IDs.
- `/api/sessions` — recent Hermes sessions grouped by source.
- `/v1/skills` — slash-command skill suggestions in the composer.
- `/v1/profiles` — profile picker when the gateway exposes profile metadata.
- `/v1/capabilities` — feature flags such as audio transcription and Browser upload support.

The DOM/context chip should show a non-zero page-context count on normal readable pages. Browser internal pages such as `chrome://extensions` are intentionally restricted.

## Remote gateway (advanced)

You can point the extension at a Hermes dashboard running on another machine (for example over Tailscale) instead of a local API server. Open Settings, pick **Remote gateway**, and enter the dashboard URL.

How it works and what it needs:

- The remote host must be reachable over **https** (the side panel is a secure context, so plain `http://` to a non-loopback host is blocked by the browser). A `tailscale serve` front with a real cert works.
- A remote, OAuth/password-gated dashboard does not use the `API_SERVER_KEY`. Instead the extension talks to the dashboard's `/api/ws` socket and authenticates with a short-lived, single-use ticket.
- That ticket is minted from a **signed-in dashboard tab**: open the dashboard URL in a normal browser tab and sign in, then keep that tab around. The extension mints the ticket first-party from that tab (the dashboard's CORS and `SameSite=Lax` cookie make a direct cross-origin mint impossible). If no signed-in tab is open, the extension tells you to open and sign in.
- **Test connection** in remote mode opens the socket and loads the model list, confirming the whole path. Sessions list, open, and create over the socket as well.

Known limitations in remote mode: image attachments are inline-only (the local image-upload endpoint is not used), and a few REST-only reads (skills, profiles) are unavailable because the dashboard's REST surface is not reachable cross-origin from the extension.

## Install with Hermes / Computer Use

You can ask Hermes to help install it:

```text
Install Hermes Browser Extension from https://github.com/abundantbeing/hermes-browser-extension. Clone it, run npm install, run npm run build, then use computer use to open chrome://extensions, enable Developer mode, load the dist folder unpacked, and help me connect it to my local Hermes Gateway API server. Do not reveal, print, screenshot, or commit my API key.
```

## Security model

Hermes Browser Extension is intentionally conservative in v0.1:

- Localhost-first connection to Hermes Gateway/API server.
- Strong bearer/API key required for local API access.
- Page content is wrapped as untrusted context before it reaches Hermes.
- Read-only browser context capture: no click, type, form-submit, checkout, download, or browser-control behavior.
- No `debugger`, `nativeMessaging`, `cookies`, `history`, `downloads`, or `bookmarks` permissions.
- Restricted pages include browser internals, extension pages, and obvious banking/crypto/password/payment/health/government-tax categories.

See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for details.

## Troubleshooting

### I loaded the extension but nothing works

Make sure you loaded `dist/`, not the repo root. The selected folder must contain `manifest.json` directly.

### The side panel says it cannot connect

Check that Hermes Gateway/API server is running and reachable:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8642/health
```

If `/v1/models` fails, check your local `API_SERVER_KEY` and CORS setting.

### The DOM chip says `0 chars`

Open a normal `https://` page and refresh context. Browser internal pages (`chrome://`, `edge://`, extension pages, devtools, etc.) are restricted by design.

### Microphone says blocked or voice dictation does not start

Chromium side panels can suppress microphone permission prompts. Hermes Browser Extension handles this with a visible extension voice page:

1. Click the mic button in the side panel.
2. If the side panel cannot capture the mic, a **Hermes Voice Dictation** tab opens.
3. In that tab, click **Start dictation**. This click is the permission gesture Chromium expects.
4. Speak, then click **Stop + transcribe**.
5. The transcript is sent back to the side panel composer automatically.

If Chromium still says the mic is blocked, click **Open microphone settings** in the voice tab and set Microphone to **Allow** for `chrome-extension://<the Hermes extension id>/`, then return to the voice tab and try again.

### The first-run Connect flow is unavailable

Use **Manual setup** with your local Gateway URL and API key. The native Desktop approval flow is still evolving during alpha.

## Development

```bash
npm test
npm run check:js
npm run check:manifest
npm run verify
npm run build
npm run package
```
